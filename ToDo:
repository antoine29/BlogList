ToDo:
- an anon user should be able to see blog comments but not to create a comment
- when an anon user clicks on the likes btn, the 'registration needed' modal should open



- create blog/content should be a MD field NOT A PRIORITY?
- fix/add cypress e2e tests
- nested comments
- clicking on likes should list (pop up) the users who liked the post
  // uix improvement is needed since in the FB case, a dedicated like button is placed on to like a post, while clicking the actual number shows the liking users
- avatars 
- add a view model of the mongo collections
- TS ? neehh
- action to build and update docs/gh page files on every tag/push?
- move bend to java springbot
- double check req user auth/credentials/permissions


very experimental:
- change DB to JSON storage ? why? and what about the backend
- changing the BD to json maybe we can automatize this app
to make it alive without needing a BEnd?
- oauth login?
- GH action to save the changes into the JSON DB


- other DB option would be a google spreedsheet?
(depending on how the MD editor goes)

- AWS serverless/lambda functions? (since they have generous free tier)
(good option to gain experience)
