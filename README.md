## Local development
Check each `README.md` folder for instructions about how to set each project in console mode.

## Production (locally)
You can serve the whole stack locally and in production mode, using a Docker-Compose file.
First edit every compose `environment` variable in the `docker-compose-local.yml` and then run the project with:
```console
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```
